# 青雀，作为我在这个游戏中最喜欢的角色之一，我能想到的第一个角色就是她了，独特的机制让她在各种环境下有着很高的上限和下限。
# 但这不是我喜欢她的最重要原因，而是她非常可爱。😊


# Qing Que, as one of my favorite characters in this game, is the first character I can think of, with unique mechanics that give her a high ceiling and a high floor in a variety of environments.
# But that's not the most important reason why I like her, it's that she's very cute. 😊
